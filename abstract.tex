A representation is a group homomorphism whose image is a group of invertible matrices. Representations can be analyzed through the well-known techniques of linear algebra. We characterize by the decomposition of matrices into irreducible components much the same way as we characterize the decomposition of matrices into their eigenspaces. Through the study of these representations, we uncover mathematical relationships that underlie physical groups. Due to physical symmetries, we study how the irreducible representations of groups that personify the actions of even the most basic rotations can be utilized in the computation of irreducible representations for more physically robust groups, like the Poincar\'e Group. Further, we can utilize the representations of the abstract braid group to gain key insights into understanding the behavior of anyonic systems in quantum mechanics. Finally, lwe ook to the behavior of Fibonacci anyons for ways to understand the underlying braid relations in action.
