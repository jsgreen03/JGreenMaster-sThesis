A representation is a group homomorphism whose image is a group of invertible matrices. Representations and their associated matrices are analyzed through well-established techniques from linear algebra. We characterize representations by the decomposition of matrices into irreducible components just as we characterize the decomposition of matrices into their eigenspaces. Through the study of these representations, we uncover mathematical relationships that underlie groups with physical applications. Due to physical symmetries, we study how the irreducible representations of groups that embody the actions of even the most basic rotations are utilized in the computation of irreducible representations groups that reflect more complicated mechanics, like the Poincar\'e Group. Further, we utilize the representations of the abstract braid group to gain key insights into understanding the behavior of anyonic systems in quantum mechanics. Finally, we explore the behavior of Fibonacci anyons for ways to understand to illustrate the underlying braid relations.
